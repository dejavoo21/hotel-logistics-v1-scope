4. How to future-proof the integration

Even though you’re building separately, do these small things now so they can connect later:

Use a shared ID pattern

Every room should have a unique room_code (e.g. HOTEL1-101)

Logistics can store room_code on maintenance tickets even before integration.

Shared user concept

Use similar users table in both apps (id, email, role)

Later you can move to a single auth service or SSO if you want.

Plan 2–3 APIs for “later”
Don’t implement yet, just design them in a doc:

HMS → Logistics:

/api/forecast/linen?month=2025-07 (send occupancy forecast)

Logistics → HMS:

/api/maintenance/status?room=HOTEL1-101

Shared:

/api/rooms (read-only list of rooms)

That way when you’re ready, you aren’t starting from zero.

5. Concrete next move

If you like this plan, I’d suggest:

Pick HMS or Logistics to do first (my vote: HMS – easier to demo and feels “alive” quickly).
